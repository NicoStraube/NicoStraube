### Hi there, I'm Nico, a 17 year old computer science enthusiastic student from Germany. ðŸ‘‹

<hr>

Currently I'm attending a vocational high school. My biggest interests are computer science and sports.

Here you can find my projects for school (mostly in Pascal) and my other ones (almost exclusively Java or Kotlin).

You can reach me by email at contact@nicostraube.de.
